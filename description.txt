Set alerts to remind you of important tasks or info each time you wake up your device or each time you unlock it.

This is an enhanced version of the LockMemos tweak with new features. As well as setting your own memos, automatic alerts can be set to remind you:
- to charge your device when the battery falls below a certain level
- that your ringer is set to silent (or that it's switched on if you prefer)

You can turn off the "Memo" title on alerts if you don't like it.

All options configured from Settings app.
